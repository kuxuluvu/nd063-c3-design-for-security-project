Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.


1. EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)
2. Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 22
3. Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
4. Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk
5. CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-Region trail that includes read and write management events
6. VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Update EC2 instances to use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)
2. Limit IP address for security group on port 22
3. Limit access to specific IP addresses, such as office IPs or internal VPC subnets, rather than 0.0.0.0/0 for security group
4. Enable CloudTrail and configured with at least one multi-Region trail that includes read and write management events
5. Enable VPC flow logging
